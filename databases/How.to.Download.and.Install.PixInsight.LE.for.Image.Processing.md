## Downloading PixInsight LE
 
To download PixInsight LE, you need to visit the [PixInsight Home Page](https://pixinsight.com/) and look for the download link for the latest version of PixInsight LE. You can choose between two formats: an executable module (.exe) or a Windows Installer module (.msi). The executable module is a self-extracting archive that will launch the installation procedure when you double-click it. The Windows Installer module is a standard installation package that will be handled by the Windows Installer service.
 
If you are installing version 1.0.1 or later, you also need to decide whether you want to download and install PixInsight LE with or without a local copy of the official documentation. The local copy of the documentation allows you to access the help files offline, but it requires more disk space. The online documentation is always up-to-date, but it requires an internet connection to access it. You can find more information about the help and documentation system in the [PixInsight LE User's Guide](https://pixinsight.com/doc/legacy/LE/05_help/help.html).
 
Alternatively, you can download PixInsight LE from other sources, such as Google Drive. However, we recommend that you always download PixInsight LE from the official website to ensure that you get the latest and most reliable version.
