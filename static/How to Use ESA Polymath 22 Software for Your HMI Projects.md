In this article, we will show you how to use ESA Polymath 2.2 software for your HMI projects, from creating a new project to testing and transferring it to your HMI device.
 
## Creating a New Project
 
To create a new project in ESA Polymath 2.2, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Open ESA Polymath 2.2 software and click on File > New Project.
2. Select the type of HMI device you want to use for your project (IT, SC or VT) and the model number.
3. Enter a name for your project and choose a folder to save it.
4. Click on OK to create your project.

## Designing Your Interface
 
Once you have created your project, you can start designing your interface using the graphical editor of ESA Polymath 2.2. You can use the following tools and features:

- The Objects Library, which contains a variety of objects that you can drag and drop onto your interface, such as buttons, lamps, gauges, graphs, keyboards, etc.
- The Properties Window, which allows you to modify the appearance and behavior of each object, such as size, color, font, text, value, action, etc.
- The Page Manager, which allows you to organize your interface into different pages and levels, and switch between them easily.
- The Dictionary, which allows you to create and manage variables and tags that store data and communicate with external devices.
- The Simulator, which allows you to test your interface in offline or online mode, without transferring it to your HMI device.

## Transferring Your Project
 
When you have finished designing your interface, you can transfer your project to your HMI device using one of the following methods:

- The Transfer Tool, which allows you to transfer your project via USB or Ethernet cable.
- The Data Transfer Tool, which allows you to transfer only the data (variables and tags) of your project via USB or Ethernet cable.
- The Backup/Restore Tool, which allows you to backup or restore your project on an SD card or a USB flash drive.

To use any of these tools, you need to click on Tools > Transfer/Backup/Restore in ESA Polymath 2.2 software and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
## Conclusion
 
ESA Polymath 2.2 is a user-friendly and powerful software for creating HMI interfaces for your industrial applications. It offers a wide range of objects, functions and features that allow you to customize your interface according to your needs and preferences. It also provides easy and fast ways to test and transfer your project to your HMI device.
